# Hackathon Climate Informatics Conference 2020
This Repository contains code of participants of the Hackathon at the Climate Informatics Conference 2020 (https://ci2020.web.ox.ac.uk) and also may contain work on the same problem developed after the competition. The aim of the Coding competition was to predict the visible spectrum of an image by using the infra-red observation in the night.

Now there is a public version of the hackathon avaiable: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/26644#participate
